My name is **Cheng-Shih Wong** (in Chinese: **翁丞世**), and you can also call me **Cody**.
I am a software engineer at Google, New Taipei City, Taiwan, leading a project
which is to provide a validation environment for Google chips.

Previously, I was a research assistant at Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.
I worked on Map AI projects with [prof. Richard Tzong-Han Tsai](https://www.iisr.csie.ncu.edu.tw/faculty) (from Academia Sinica) and [prof. Ming-Ching Chang](https://www.albany.edu/faculty/mchang2/).
Before Sinica,
I was a research developer at [Synology Inc.](www.synology.com) and developed world-class Network Attached Storage products.

I received my M.S. degree in Graduate Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics, College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) and earned my B.S. degree in Department of Computer Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, [National Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.nsysu.edu.tw/?Lang=en).

<!--Research interests-->
<!--======-->
<!--My research interests lie in  computer vision and visual representation learning, self-supervised machine learning, and resource-limited system profiling and application of embedded systems. I aim to push the line of machine vision understanding closer to that of human vision understanding and to minimize the boundary between computer vision algorithms and operating system architecture.-->
