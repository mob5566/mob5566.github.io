My name is **Cheng-Shih Wong** (in Chinese: **翁丞世**), and you can also call me **Cody**. I have been a research assistant at Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan since June 2021. I currently work on Map AI projects with [prof. Richard Tzong-Han Tsai](https://www.iisr.csie.ncu.edu.tw/faculty) (from Academia Sinica) and [prof. Ming-Ching Chang](https://www.albany.edu/faculty/mchang2/). Before Sinica, I was a research developer at [Synology Inc.](www.synology.com) and developed world-class Network Attached Storage products.

<!--I received my M.S. degree in [Graduate Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics](http://www.bebi.ntu.edu.tw/web/index/index.jsp?lang=en), [College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.eecs.ntu.edu.tw/?locale=en), [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) and earned my B.S. degree in [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.nsysu.edu.tw/), [College of Engineering](https://www.engnsysu.com.tw/), [National Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.nsysu.edu.tw/?Lang=en).-->

Research interests
======
My research interests lie in  computer vision and visual representation learning, self-supervised machine learning, and resource-limited system profiling and application of embedded systems. I aim to push the line of machine vision understanding closer to that of human vision understanding and to minimize the boundary between computer vision algorithms and operating system architecture.
